## Methods

- Moving Average
- ARMA
- ARIMA
- SARIMA. 
  - The ```statsmodels``` implementation called this SARIMAX because the “X” addition to the method name means that the implementation also supports exogenous variables.

## Packages 

- [Python-SARIMAX](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX.html)
